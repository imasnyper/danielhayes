-Finish Blog
  -add archive view(filter posts by month/day/year) to blog index
  -add tags to blog posts
  -make blog index the home page
  -add some kind of very light CMS. All I envision neeeding for this site is a basic WYSIWYG editor for new blog posts, to insert photos or code blocks.
-delete polls app(or hide it until a later date)
-add about page
-add portfolio page(eventually link to the business website offering website development services)
-add contact page
